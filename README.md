This is a simple implementation of monocular and stereo visual odometry. Our goal is to apply visual odometry in drone which
requires real time performance and high accuracy. To increase the accuracy of trajectory estimation, we are going to fuse 
multiple sensor, such as camera, IMU, lidar and so on.
