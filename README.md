This is a simple implementation of monocular and stereo visual odometry. Our goal is to deploy visual odometry on a drone which requires real time performance and high accuracy. To increase the accuracy of trajectory estimation, we are going to fuse multiple sensor, such as camera, IMU, lidar and so on.
